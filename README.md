# Nature Scents
## Bring the aroma of nature into your home âœ¨

An e-commerce store with products that fill your home with the scents of the natural world, bringing calm, and brightening your day.

## User Experience(UX)

### Strategy Plane
Target Audience:

- People aged 16-55
- Users who like natural scents
- Users who want to improve their home space
- Users interested in health, nature and natural products
- Users who want to regularly receive new products through subscription 

The user can purchase one off items on the site, which makes the site useful to anyone who visits looking to purchase a product. The site also offers product combination bundles for users who want to try out a range of products, possibly buy as gifts etc. The final option for users is to purchase a yearly membership where they will be 'sent a new scent' every month from the essential oils product section. This yearly subscription keeps the user engaged with the site, and may also lead to further purchases. 

This e-commerce sit is a B2C model. The goal of the site is to not only make one off sales but to encourage brand loyalty through subscription and a newsletter. The site uses minimal design, and a no frills up front approach to let the products speak for themselves.
