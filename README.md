# Nature Scents
## Bring the aroma of nature into your home âœ¨

An e-commerce store with products that fill your home with the scents of the natural world, bringing calm, and brightening your day.

## User Experience(UX)

### Strategy Plane
Target Audience:

- People aged 16-55
- Users who like natural scents
- Users who want to improve their home space
- Users interested in health, nature and natural products
- Users who want to regularly receive new products through subscription 

The user can purchase <strong>one off items</strong> on the site, which makes the site useful to anyone who visits looking to purchase a product. The site also offers <strong>product combination bundles</strong> for users who want to try out a range of products, possibly buy as gifts etc. The final option for users is to purchase a <strong>yearly membership</strong> where they will be <strong>'sent a new scent'</strong> every month from the essential oils product section. This yearly subscription keeps the user engaged with the site, and may also lead to further purchases. 

This e-commerce sit is a B2C model. The goal of the site is to not only make one off sales but to encourage brand loyalty through subscription and a newsletter. The site uses minimal design, and a no frills up front approach to let the products speak for themselves.

## Surface Plane

**Colour Scheme**
<br>
<br>
<img src="supporting_docs/design/colourscheme.png">
<br>
<br> 
I have chosen this colour scheme as it is a combination or warm and calming tones which I feel matches the mood of the site, and the products on offer. The pink and orange contrast well with the darker blue and grey tones. 

**Fonts**
<br>
<br>
<img src="supporting_docs/design/fonts.png">
<br>
<br>
I chose Josefin Sans as the main font on the site, as it is simple and clean. I combined this with the Cardo font.
